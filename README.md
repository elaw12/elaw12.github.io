### Assyrian Family Aid Website
![Assyrian Family Aid Website](assets/img/AFA_SS.JPG)
As a volunteer, I designed and developed the official website for Assyrian Family Aid, a nonprofit supporting Assyrian communities. I handled the full web build, domain linking, and SEO optimization to help the organization establish a strong digital presence and reach more supporters. The site serves as a central hub for sharing their mission, accepting donations, and promoting ongoing projects.

### Lawando's Food Mart Inventory
![Lawando's Food Mart](assets/img/lawnados_food_mart.jpg)
Led a point-of-sale inventory setup for Lawando’s Food Mart, a Middle Eastern grocery store. Using Excel, Python, and Power Query, I compiled, cleaned, and organized product data from multiple vendors to build a clean and functional inventory database. I also analyzed market data to determine competitive pricing for over 3,000 inventory items. This project supported the store’s launch and helped streamline ongoing operations through automation and structured data management.
